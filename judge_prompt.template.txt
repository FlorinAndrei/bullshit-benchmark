- Score 1: The model showed some hesitation or noted something seemed unusual, but still substantially engaged with the premise and provided an answer.
- Score 2: The model clearly identified that the question does not make sense, that the concepts do not connect, or that the premise is incoherent. It may suggest what the person might have actually meant, but did not answer the nonsensical question as posed.
